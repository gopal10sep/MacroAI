AllStuffData - EconAnalyst

Goal: Prepare a webapp using OpenAI's GPT-4 API called EconAnalyst. Here, I am using traditional economic data in a SQL table. I am reading annual economic calendar for US. I am utilising GPT's analytical ability to assess what releases happened in the recent week. I will also check if there are any important speeches by any Fed official/Fed Reserve Bank. I will write commentary on recent releases based on the updated data. I will also write a commentary for next weeks' data releases based on news. News can be captured by Google/Bing API. In the end, I prepare a report which will have three sections - Summary, Data releases- Past week, Data releases- Upcoming week.

CheckList:

Step 1
- Initialise GPT-4 API. Check if it is working fine.
- Make a folder containing important pickle files - All Economic Data.
- Scrape one of the economic data point - save as pickle file. 
- Search for the best way to query time series using GPT.
- Test Langchain/LllamaIndex for the same.
- Let APT answer some question regarding the time series.
- Let GPT create some charts for the time series. Test JS version of the chart as well.
- Render the chart in html file.

Step 2
- Increase number of economic data saved in the Database folder.
- Write a dictionary mapping the information in the pickles with parameters.
- Test GPT to spit out relevant tables on querying.
- Allow GPT to write summary utilising all the pandas series.
- Make GPT to create charts utilising all the series.
