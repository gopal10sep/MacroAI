## Project Story

### About the Project

MacroAI, an AI-powered Econ Research Assistant, is the product of my journey to simplify the research process for economists and analysts, providing instant access to economic insights and analysis. The platform offers two primary features:

**Data Query**: This feature allows users to ask any query related to economic data. Users can input their queries, and MacroAI will generate relevant charts and summarize the information for that specific query. The platform leverages cutting-edge technologies, such as High Edge OpenAI, Llama-Index, LangChain, and a combination of both publicly available and self-collected data sources.

**Data Chat**: The Data Chat feature enables users to open a series and engage in a conversational interaction with that specific data series. MacroAI provides pre-made charts displaying line trends for the selected series. The chatbot, integrated into the platform, facilitates meaningful discussions and provides insights based on the data series chosen.

My future plans involve expanding the platform to cover all economic series, ensuring that users have comprehensive access to a wide range of economic data for analysis and decision-making.

#### Inspiration and Learning

The inspiration behind MacroAI came from my experience working as an economic research analyst. I observed the immense potential of AI in disrupting the industry, making research tasks easier and more efficient. As a researcher, I often faced challenges in finding relevant data, creating charts, and deriving insights from vast amounts of information. I realized that an AI-powered solution could streamline these processes and provide immediate access to valuable economic insights.

During the project development phase, I learned the significance of leveraging advanced AI technologies, such as High Edge OpenAI, Llama-Index, and LangChain, to enhance the capabilities of MacroAI. These technologies helped in automating various tasks, including natural language processing, data analysis, and visualization. Furthermore, I gained insights into data collection methods, combining publicly available datasets with self-collected data to create a comprehensive and reliable source for economic analysis.

#### Building the Project

To build MacroAI, I employed a combination of cutting-edge AI technologies and robust data collection practices. The project involved several key steps:

1. **Research and Planning**: I conducted extensive research to understand the needs of economists and analysts, as well as the challenges they face during the research process. Based on the insights gained, I planned the features and functionalities of MacroAI, emphasizing the importance of user-friendly interfaces and efficient data processing.
   
2. **Technology Integration**: I integrated various AI technologies into the platform. High Edge OpenAI allowed me to incorporate powerful natural language processing capabilities, enabling users to ask queries in a conversational manner. Llama-Index provided advanced data analysis tools, and LangChain facilitated smooth communication between users and the chatbot.
   
3. **Data Collection and Validation**: I collected a wide range of economic data from different sources, including publicly available datasets and self-collected data. The data was carefully validated to ensure accuracy and reliability. This process involved cross-referencing multiple sources and implementing quality control measures.
   
4. **Platform Development**: With the acquired skills, I built the MacroAI platform, focusing on creating an intuitive user interface and seamless user experience. I implemented the Data Query feature to generate charts and summarize information based on user queries. For the Data Chat feature, I integrated a chatbot specifically designed to provide insights on selected data series.
   
5. **Testing and Refinement**: I conducted extensive testing to identify any bugs or issues and refined the platform based on user feedback. This iterative process helped me improve the overall performance and usability of MacroAI.
